Perfect! I can see you have TikTok Business API credentials. Let me implement the official TikTok API integration using your App ID and Secret. This will replace the web scraping approach with professional API calls.


Edited .env.example
Now I'll create a professional TikTok API service to replace the web scraping approach. I'll implement the official TikTok Business API integration with OAuth authentication and creator management.


Executed mkdir -p server/services

Created server/services/tiktok-api.ts
Now I'll create an enhanced session manager that uses the official TikTok API instead of web scraping, and integrate OAuth authentication flow.


Created server/services/tiktok-session-manager.ts
I'll install the missing axios dependency and update the API routes to integrate the official TikTok API.


Installed axios
Now I'll update the routes to integrate the official TikTok API service and add OAuth authentication endpoints.

Let me check the current routes file structure and add the TikTok API integration:

I need to fix the schema mapping issues in the TikTok session manager. Let me update it to use the correct database schema field names:

I need to fix the schema field mapping errors in the TikTok API service. Let me update the service to use the correct database schema field names:

I'll create a simplified API integration approach that works with the current database schema. Let me add the TikTok API OAuth endpoints to the routes and fix the schema compatibility issues.

Let me add the TikTok API endpoints to the routes file properly and create a simplified production-ready API integration.


Opened server/routes.ts
Let me add the TikTok API endpoints to the routes and create a professional production-ready integration.


Opened server/routes.ts
I'll add the TikTok API endpoints to complete the professional production integration. Let me insert the new API routes before the health check endpoint.


Edited server/routes.ts
Now I'll create a production-ready dashboard component to manage the TikTok API integration and provide a professional interface for the official API functionality.


Created client/src/components/TikTokAPIManager.tsx
I'm now creating a professional TikTok API integration page and updating the application to support both web scraping and official API modes. Let me add the TikTok API Manager to the main dashboard.


Opened client/src/App.tsx
I'll create a TikTok API Management page and integrate it into the main application navigation to provide professional API functionality.


Created client/src/pages/tiktok-api.tsx
Now I'll add the TikTok API page to the navigation and complete the professional production integration:
